                "In the past there was a king called Raja Maha-Sammatha. His queen was pregnant and she was craving for a performance by a group wearing masks. Even though, the royal dancing troupes delivered performances, the queen was not satisfied. Even performances from different countries were of no avail. Hence, the queen and the king were disappointed. God Indra(or Shakraaccording to some sources), invoked the god of creation and demanded that queen’s cravings were satisfied. The god of creation created a mask and a book with instructions and hid those in the royal garden. The gardener revealed the information the following day. Hence the king ordered the royal performers to wear the masks and perform. Queen’s craving was thus satisfied."
