                <p className='text'>There are many meanings to the world kolam,even though it is used to name a folk drama. Accordingly, at present, meanings such as being over-realistic, and inappropriate are used. The word kolamis used in utterances such as “mala kolamak”(nuts!), “kolam karanna epaa”(don’t be funny), “enawada methana kolam natanna”(what do you think you are doing).<br />
                In the past, the term was used to denote an act performed by wearing masks. For example, the Loweda Sangarawaby Vidagama Maithri Therostates that, “paala giya weni bahu ru kolam.”The word is also used for masks, and according to tradition, making a mask was known as “kolam kapanawa”. Kolam kuttama is used for a collection of kolammasks or a group of kolamdance drama performers.<br />
                kolamis also used to express a decoration done by Tamils using rice flour. In Telengu language, kolammeans dance. In Kannada, the word kolam is used for make-up.<br />
                However, the word used for a dance performed by wearing masks is called the kolamdance. This includes a string of events or a story enacted using dialogues, dance, gestures and song according to the beats of the drum.
